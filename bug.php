In PHP, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with array keys.  If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error, but instead return `null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the `null` value is used in subsequent calculations or comparisons without proper checking. For example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c'] * 2; // $myArray['c'] is null, leading to 0
echo $value; // Outputs 0
```

This behavior is different from languages like JavaScript, which might throw a `TypeError` in this case.
